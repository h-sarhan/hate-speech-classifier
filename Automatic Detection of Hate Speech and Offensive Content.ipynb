    "In this assignment I will go through the steps of building a classifier that can detect hateful content, and after that I will give a practical demonstration of how this model can be used on real world data.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the reasons I chose to work on this topic is because I feel there is not enough being done to curb the rampant online harassment that people have to deal with on social media. Hate speech, racial slurs, offensive content, threats of violence, and unwanted sexual comments are against the terms of service of all major social media websites, and yet for some people they are as common as cat gifs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some reasons why people get harassed online are because of their gender, race, sexual orientation, or political views. Of course, none of these are good reasons as to why you should be hostile towards someone, but many people do not realize this. The majority of online harassment occurs on social media websites [$^{citation}$](), so the responsibility falls on these large tech companies to look after their users' safety and wellbeing. Unfortunately, these companies are not doing enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at how Facebook moderates its content. Most of Facebook's content moderation team does not work directly for Facebook as they are outsourced, and there are not that many of them. [$^{citation}$]() Facebook uses a hybrid system to moderate their content. Content is input into an A.I. model and will be flagged for review if the model detects any content violating the platform's terms of service. (Users can also flag content for review) This model does prevent a lot of harmful content from being seen, but it clearly could be implemented better based on the amount of users experiencing harassment on the platform. This model is also used to filter spam, fake news, and adult content, but of course this type of content is still very common on Facebook. [$^{citation}$]() Given the low number of human moderators, only 15,000 for over 2.9 billion monthly active users, [$^{citation}$]() [$^{citation}$]() there is a huge burden on Facebook's classifier to correctly flag objectionable content.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of classifier can also of course be used by any website that hosts a significant amount of user-generated content. So it is of great importance to any type of social media website. The techniques shown here can be used to build a classifier that can detect spam, fake news, or explicit sexual content, provided you have appropriate dataset of course."
